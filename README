This is the rudimentary beginnings of the 96BoardGPIO library
to control real world hardware via the GPIO on the 96Boards family of
boards that confirm to the CE spec.

One of the cool things about the 96Boards CE project is that all of the
boards us the same pins for the Low Speed Expansion Connector so you can
plug any expansion board into any 96Board and it will connect electrically
BUT there is a issue where GPIO is concerned.  Different SoC's have
different GPIO pins.  So even though electrically the pins are in the same
place it takes differnt code to enable and use the GPIO on pins 23 - 34. 
Not so fun.

The 96BoardGPIO library trys to abstract the info so that you can just
tell it what board you are using and what pins you want to use and the
library does the rest.

Early days, there are lots of improvements that can and I expect will
be made.  Lookup tables need to be externalized into XML so that the library
will not requre recomplation to add a new 96Boards board.  We need to
identify how we know what board is what at run time so we only need to call
an init library call and not have to input the board name.  The entire read
side needs work to setup and control the input settings.

In the mean time the demo.c file is a demo of running a motorized 
1" 12 vdc ball valve via a 5 vdc set of relays and turning on and off
said relays just becasue we can. 

The code so far has been tested on a Dragonboard 410 c where it is known to
work very well.

The gpio.c file will become a shared library that will be the under pinings
of a Python, Perl, Java and C++ librarys.  First to finish the C version.
